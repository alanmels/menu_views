# Menu Views

Menu Views is a utility module. It provides back end support for replacing a 
standard menu item link with a menu item view. Menu items (in any menu) now 
have the option of toggling between two different menu item types: link or 
view. Depending on which option is selected, the appropriate configuration 
form is displayed on the admin side and the appropriate type of item is 
rendered on the front-end.
